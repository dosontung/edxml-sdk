EDXML SDK
=========

**EDXML_** is a versatile, simple and semantic data representation that facilitates
complex data integration projects.

This repository contains the **EDXML Software Development Kit (SDK)**. The
SDK contains a number of example Python_ applications, which demonstrate inspecting and
validating EDXML data. The applications are based the Python classes in the 
edxml Python package, which is also part of this SDK.

For developing EDXML processing scripts based on the Python classes offered by
the edxml package, all you need to do is install the edxml package into the
Python library path of your development system. Symlinking the edxml subdirectory
to the location of your Python script will also work. You can then use the appropriate
import statements to import the package components that your script will need.
