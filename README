This directory tree contains the EDXML Software Development Kit (SDK). The
SDK contains a number of commandline tools (in the python-source dir), which 
may be used for inspecting and validating EDXML data. The commandline tools
are based the Python classes in the python-source/edxml subdirectory, and can
therefore also serve as examples of how the Python classes can be used.

For developing EDXML processing scripts based on the Python classes offered by
the SDK, all you need to do is copy the python-source/edxml subdirectory to the
Python library path of your development system. Copying the python-source/edxml
subdirectory into the location of your Python script will also work. You can then
use the appropriate import statements to import the components of edxml.* that 
your script will need.

The SDK is distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License,
which means that both Open Source and commercial software can be based on it, as
long as you meet the conditions outlined in the license document.
